==== A2 phase I marking ====
Your assignment is marked by:
Products and Sprint backlogs - Syeda Rahman, suhailah.rahman@mail.utoronto.ca
Design - Amol Dosanjh, amol.dosanjh@mail.utoronto.ca
Java Style/Javadoc/Correctness - Brian Lam, brianandrew.lam@mail.utoronto.ca

Total deductions: -3
Grade: B+
Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:
    http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/newstudents/transition/academic/grading
The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:
     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog.
==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6]
Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:
- [ ]  No evidence of Product or Sprint backlog -6
- [ ]  No evidence of team assigning tasks to team members -3
- [ ]  SB items not taken directly from PB -1
- [ ]  SB items not broken down into smaller steps -1
- [ ]  PB, SB uses noticeably bad grammar and/or spelling -2
TA Comments: You should space out your user stories among the 3 sprints. It's better to test for bugs/other things in the same sprint as its user story.
