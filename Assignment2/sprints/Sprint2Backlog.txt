// Sprint 2 Backlog
June 20 to June 26

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I can print out the contents of current working directory so that I know what files/folders are under current working directory.
b) As a user, I can print out the contents of any directory so that I know what files/folders are under any working directories.
c) As a user, I can print the documentation of all commands by calling the man command so that I can understand how to properly interact with the shell	
d) As a user, I can print out the contents of multiple files at once and be able to differentiate them, so that I know what is under each file. 
e) As a user, I can create a new text file containing any string I input, so that I can have the ability to store my string inputs.
f) As a user, I can erase the contents of text files, so that I can write something else in the txt file. 
g) As a user, I can overwrite the contents of any text file with any string I input, so that I have the ability to overwrite the txt file.
h) As a user, I can write at the end of any existing txt file, so that I can be able to edit text file without deleteing everything before. 
i) As a user, I can move into the saved directories and remove them.
