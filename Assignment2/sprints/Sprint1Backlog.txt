// Sprint 1 Backlog
June 13 to June 19

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I can input characters into the shell so that I can interact with the shell.
b) As a user, I can exit the shell by calling exit command so that exiting the shell is simple.
c) As a user, I can print out the history of all my inputs regardless if it's invalid or not, so that I can recall what I have done.
d)

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. (Shell) Create class Shell
a-2. (Shell) In main method, create an algorithm that continuously asks for and interprets user inputs by converting input to string
b-1. (Exit) Create class Exit 
b-2. (Exit) Create a method that breaks out of the loop in Shell main method once it is called by user
c-1. (History) Create class History
c-2. (InputHistory) Create class InputHistory
c-3. (InputHistory) Create an ordered list that stores all user inputs regardless of validity
