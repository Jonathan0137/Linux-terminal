// Sprint 1 Backlog
June 13 to June 19

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I can input characters into the shell so that I can interact with the shell.
b) As a user, I can exit the shell by calling exit command so that exiting the shell is simple.
c) As a user, I can print out the history of all my inputs regardless if it's invalid or not, so that I can recall what I have done.
d) As a user, I can print any string onto the shell so that I can output whatever I type.  	
e) As a user, I can save the current working directory so that I can have easy access to the directory.
f) As a user, I can change my current working directory by writing a relative path, so that I can move to other directories.	


Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. (Shell) Create class Shell
a-2. (Shell) In main method, create an algorithm that continuously asks for and interprets user inputs by converting input to string
b-1. (Exit) Create class Exit 
b-2. (Exit) Create a method that breaks out of the loop in Shell main method once it is called by user
c-1. (History) Create class History
c-2. (InputHistory) Create class InputHistory
c-3. (InputHistory) Create an ordered list that stores all user inputs regardless of validity
c-4. (History) Create a method that accesses InputHistory's user input list and prints the whole history
c-5. (History) Create a method that can print a specific number of most recent user inputs
d-1. (Echo) Create class Echo
d-2. (Echo) Write base code for the Echo class to print input to shell
e-1. Create classes FileSystem, File, Directory, DirectoryStack, and Pushd
e-2. (FileSystem) Write code for the FileSystem class so that it can organize directories and files into a hierarchy
e-3. (File) Write base code for the File class so that it can store information about a file's contents
e-4. (Directory) Write base code for the Directory class so that it can store information about a directory and its contents
e-5. (DirectoryStack) Write base code for the DirectoryStack Class so that it can store a directory stack
e-6. (Pushd) Write code for the Pushd class so that it can add a directory to the DirectoryStack
f-1. (Cd) Create class Cd
f-2. (Cd) Write code for Cd class so that the user can change their working directory
