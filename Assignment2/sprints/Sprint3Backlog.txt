// Sprint 3 Backlog
June 27 to July 4

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
- This week, the tasks are not really based on user stories (since we are pretty much finished all of our user stories)

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. Writing tests to ensure the program is behaving as expected, and considering edge cases
a-2. Debugging potential bugs to ensure the pronblem is functioning properly
a-3. Moving methods from FileSystem and Directory to Command to better follow SRP


These tasks are assignment as follows:

// NOTE: Done all user stories, all that's left is testing/debugging/refactoring code, how do we write these as tasks? Since tasks are supposed to be based off user stories.
