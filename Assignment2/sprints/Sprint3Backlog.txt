// Sprint 3 Backlog
June 27 to July 4

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
- This week, the tasks are not really based on user stories (since we are pretty much finished all of our user stories)

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. Writing tests to ensure the program is behaving as expected, and considering edge cases
a-2. Debugging potential bugs to ensure the pronblem is functioning properly
a-3. Moving methods from FileSystem and Directory to Command to better follow SRP
b-1. Debugging my code to make sure that there is no error in the system.
b-2. Adding Java docs to my code.
c-1. Complete echo command
c-2. Test echo command
c-3. Fix history command
c-4. Test history command
c-5. Test and fix any potential bugs related to JShell
c-6. Test and fix any potential bugs related to exit command
d-1. Test and fix potential bugs in pwd
d-2. Test and fix potential bugs in mkdir
d-3. Test and fix potential bugs in cat


These tasks are assignment as follows:

Tasks: a-1, a-2, a-3

User: Tom Daudelin
Tasks: c-1, c-2, c-3, c-4, c-5, c-6

User: Chongmin Bai

User: Adil Shah
Tasks: d-1, d-2, d-3

// NOTE: Done all user stories, all that's left is testing/debugging/refactoring code, how do we write these as tasks? Since tasks are supposed to be based off user stories.
