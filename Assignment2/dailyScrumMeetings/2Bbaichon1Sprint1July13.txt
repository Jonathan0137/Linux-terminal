What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Upgraded Class Man by replacing if statments with hashtable
 	- Learned to use regex to verifiy userinput
	- implemented regex to Class verifier
	- Upgraded Class Verfier by replacing if statments with hashtable
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Finish up Verifier and it's regex
	- try to solve and implement LS's new recursive features
        - write some unit test for Verifier
	- take a look at save and load
Am I blocked on anything?
    	- wondering what is input cleaner
	- worried about the difficulty of save and load
