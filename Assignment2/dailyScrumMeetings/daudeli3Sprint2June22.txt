What did I work on in the last three days?
	-I Created the EchoToFile class, the echoToFileCheck() method. I have completed all the methods and functions of this class and have begun lightly testing my code

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	-I plan on rigorously testing my code, meeting up with the team or post piazza questions to cement my understanding of my command

Am I blocked on anything?
	-I do not know exactly how some of FileSystem and Directory classes methods work and as such cannot fully debug my code as I use these methods
