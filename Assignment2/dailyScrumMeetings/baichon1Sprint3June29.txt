What did I work on in the last three days?
    - added Javadoc for my code
    - tested and debugged our code

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - thinking on maybe putting excpetion on the code rather than using if statments

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to learn how to use the try catch method
