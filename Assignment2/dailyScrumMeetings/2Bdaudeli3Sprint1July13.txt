What did I work on in the last three days?
	-I  have worked on completing Get class, I have set up for future modifications to JShell (no commit yet), I have created an Echo class and began working on merging EchoToFile and EchoToOutput

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	-I plan on completing all the classes from Sprint 1 as well as modify all my previous classes to accommodate the new changes to the way JShell outputs.

Am I blocked on anything?
	-I need help understanding how the output classes work and how people excpect my redirect code to work
