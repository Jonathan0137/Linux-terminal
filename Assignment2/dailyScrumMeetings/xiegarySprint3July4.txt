What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I tested the program to fix bugs and find edge cases in the program logic
	- I added JavaDocs for Classes and instance variables
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - N/A (since this is the last scrum meeting for 2A)
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Nothing
