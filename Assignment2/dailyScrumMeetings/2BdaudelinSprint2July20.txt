What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I have essentially completed Redirection (needs testing), I have worked on completion of Echo as well

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	-I plan on completing Get and Echo, Deleting EchoToOuptut and EchoToFile then I plan on running tests on all my classes

Am I blocked on anything?
	-I need team members inputs for a quick validation check in case the way my code works is not as intended
