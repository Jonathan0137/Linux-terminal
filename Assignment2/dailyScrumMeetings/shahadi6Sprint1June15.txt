What did I work on in the last three days?
		- discussed ideas abut crc cards with team members
		- brainstormed implementation of mkdir and pwd

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - start implementing code for mkdir, pwd and WorkingDirectory

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need FileSystem, to be completed (or at least prototyped) before I can continue working on mkdir and pwd
