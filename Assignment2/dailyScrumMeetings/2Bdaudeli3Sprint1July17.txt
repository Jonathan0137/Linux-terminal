What did I work on in the last three days?
	-I have modified JShell so that it works with the current design, I have fixed Exit class to work with the new design, I have made InputHistory singleton, I have fixed History class so that it works with current design, I have worked on Redirection class (not complete)

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	-I plan on completing the Get class, the Echo class, deleting previous echo classes and completing the Redirection class

Am I blocked on anything?
	-I need help understanding how the get command works
