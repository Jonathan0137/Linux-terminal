What did I work on in the last three days?
    - created verifer files
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for all CRC cards

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - start implementing code for verifer and Jshell

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need FileSystem, to be completed (or at least prototyped) before I can continue working
