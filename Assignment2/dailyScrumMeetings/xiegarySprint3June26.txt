What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I finished Javadocs/comments for File, FileSystem, Directory, and DirectoryStack
	- I helped my teammates debug issues with their code
	- I made some minor changes for how Cd, Pushd, and EchoToOutput read the user input
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Writing tests to ensure that classes are functioning properly, and considering edge cases
	- Refactoring code and moving some methods to different classes to improve design
	- Debugging the code
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Nothing at the moment
