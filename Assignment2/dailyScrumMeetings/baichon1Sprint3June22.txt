What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished Ls and Man class.
    - Had a rough reading week, pretty much spend all the time studying for other course's midterm, but finished my task for this week.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Test and Debug my code.
    - add javadoc for my code.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need time to study for other course, as for code, none of now.
