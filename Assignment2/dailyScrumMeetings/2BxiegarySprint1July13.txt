What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I refactored FileSystem so that it follows Singleton design pattern
	- I updated Popd and Pushd to reflect the changes made on FileSystem
	- I added FileSystem as a variable in Command so that all child classes can access it
	- I created a new Class called FileSystemNode that is the parent class of both 
	  Directory and File and combined the common methods and instance variables
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Refactor Directory class to use Hashmaps rather than ArrayLists, and combine the list of Subdirectories and list of Files into one, as a list of FileSystemNodes
	- Update the methods that manipulate Directory contents to match with the changes to Directory
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Nothing at the moment
